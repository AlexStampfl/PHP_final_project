# PHP_Final_Project

### Description
This was my final project for the **PHP class** in semester 4. It was a 'gym' themed website. Pretty basic stuff, only it was written using PHP and it connects a server and database. It had basic forms with form validation.

### How to Run Program
In order for this program to work, it must be connected to a server, and a VPN and must have access to a database. Easiest way to run is on Visual Studio Code, after you have connected to a server and the VPN.
Some sensitive information has been taken out of the code files for security.
