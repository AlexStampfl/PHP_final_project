# PHP Home Gym Website

### Description
This was my final project for the **PHP class** in semester 4. It was a 'home gym' website. Pretty basic stuff, only it was written using PHP and it connects a server and database. It had basic forms with form validation.

### How to Run Program
In order for this program to work, it must be connected to a server, and a VPN and must have access to a database. Here is the link to the PHP website, it is on Gateway's 'Prometheus' server.
